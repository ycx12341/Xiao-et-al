## ABC-BCD ##

This contains all the synthetic data generated in the attempt of applying the ABC-BCD scheme described in Xiao et al.

Some key files in each folder (Except “Consistency analysis” and “Formatted code”):
mean_var_obs.txt: Means and variances of the 240 reference time series.

Round 1 parameters 10000 ecm.txt: Initial parameters, all parameter values are sampled from corresponding initial distributions using "runif" command in R. (See Prior.R)

Round 10 parameters 10000 all 3.txt: Final parameters, the column means are taken as the final estimates of the parameters. (See Results.R)

How can the synthetic data be reproduced?
Initially, sample 10000 values for each parameter from its initial distribution in Prior.R, form them into a 10000x6 table so we have 10000 vectors of parameter values that can be substituted back to the PDE solver. This table is written in "Round 1 parameters 10000 ecm.txt"

Open the file "Automatic.R" in the folder to read in the functions, then open Results.R and use function bcd() to obtain the Bhattacharyya distance of each parameter vector in relation to the reference one, 10000 values are written in "B-C distance ecm r1.txt".

Now use function abc_bcd() to carry out the ABC-BCD optimization scheme. Read in "Round 1 parameters 10000 ecm.txt" and "B-C distance ecm r1.txt" as arguments "paras" and "ss_mat". The result of the function is written in "Round 2 parameters 10000 ecm.txt"

A full round for the evaluation of ECM profile is complete. After 3 rounds are carried out for the evaluation of ECM profile, we extract the sample of parameter eta, (4th column in "Round 4 parameters 10000 ecm.txt"), set it to be the 4th column of "Round 1 parameters 10000 ecm_mde.txt", sample the other parameter values from their initial distribution. Function bcd() in Automatic.R needs to be reloaded with line 124 being changed to for (j in 81:240) {

After 5 rounds are carried out for the evaluation of MDE profile, we extract the samples of parameter eta, dm, alpha (4th, 5th, 6th column of "Round 6 parameters 10000 ecm_mde.txt"), set them to be the 4th, 5th, 6th column of "Round 1 parameters 10000 all 3.txt", sample the other parameter values from their initial distribution. Function bcd() in Automatic.R needs to be reloaded again, with line 124 being changed to for (j in 1:240) {

After 9 rounds are carried out for the evaluation of tumour cells profile. The avarage of each column in "Round 10 parameters 10000 all 3.txt" can be calculated and taken as the final estimations of the parameters.

Folder “Consistency analysis” contains the results of Monte-Carlo errors. 

Folder “Formatted code” contains a simpler version of the code which runs the procedures above in one go.
